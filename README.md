## ⚙️ Installation
1. You can simply clone the given github repo to check the code.
2. I developed the given task by using the Laravel framework along with MySQL.
3. Instead of Heroku, we used Render to deploy the application.


## Database Connection
1. I used PostgreSQL to deploy the database in Render.
2. Here is a step-by-step guide to checking the database in your local system.
2.1: Download and install the pgadmin 4 v8 client on your system.
2.2: Once done, open PG admin and click on add new server.
2.3. In the general tab, give a name to the server, then go to the connection tab, and in the host name, use the below external database url.
2.4. External database URL: postgres://root:M9V7ZQnVXesuWzTU1ck07PKAPZQ3c1yv@dpg-co3bh5gl5elc73da91e0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/alertify_app
2.5: Now you have to use the below details to connect a DB
2.5.1: Host: dpg-co3bh5gl5elc73da91e0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com
2.5.2 - Database: alertify_app
2.5.3 - User: root
2.5.4 Password: M9V7ZQnVXesuWzTU1ck07PKAPZQ3c1yv
2.5.5 - In connection parameters, keep the SSL mode value as required.
2.6: Once you connect it to the schema, you will be able to see the tables.
